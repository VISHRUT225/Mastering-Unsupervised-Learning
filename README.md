# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning Mastery 🚀

Welcome to the **Unsupervised Learning Mastery** project! This repository demonstrates an end-to-end unsupervised learning pipeline where we explore various techniques to extract insights from retail and customer datasets. In this project, you'll find:

- **Clustering Analysis:**  
  - *K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN* on the Mall Customers dataset for customer segmentation.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:**  
  - *PCA and t-SNE* to visualize high-dimensional data (e.g., using the Wine dataset or similar).
- **Association Rule Mining:**  
  - *Apriori algorithm* for market basket analysis using the Online Retail dataset.
